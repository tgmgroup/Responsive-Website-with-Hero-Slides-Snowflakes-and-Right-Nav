# Responsive Website Example

This responsive website has these features:
- Hero slides
- Rainbow wave background for the hero
- JavaScript falling snowflakes (use scripts-mouse_effects.js to see mouse tracking and force-field effects at the cost of performance)
- Right icon-based nav bar (top on mobile)

Made for a bit of fun with the help of Google Gemini.
